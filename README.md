# Elevated-Rock-Paper-Scissors-Scissors
Welcome to Rock Paper Scissors Scissors! 

To compile and run the game in your system run the following commands:

1. Fork this repository and download it in your local machine
1. javac ItemSystem.java HighScoreTable.java GamePanel.java EffectsManager.java RockPaperScissorsGame.java Main.java 
2. java Main.java

## Debugging Notes

* Need to fix audio parameters: the reading of the path when trying to get access to the .wav files makes the game's HighScoreTable loop forever, need to fix that before next Friday.
* Audio issue is caused by me running the program through wsl2, ask another person to run program through their cmd.
* Still have issues with the HighSCoreTable infinite loop, fix later.
